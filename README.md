+ Project summary: Deep learning in practice can be complicated due to the existence of design choices that go into a neural network model. These choices include network architecture,
optimization, initialization, and regularization, and they can have a substantial
impact on the performance of trained neural network models. This begs the
question of how robust the models are to these design choices. Here, we investigate
how these choices can affect out-of-sample performance and whether good choices
for one dataset translate into good choices for another dataset.
