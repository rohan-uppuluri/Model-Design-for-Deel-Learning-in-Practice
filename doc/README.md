### Doc folder

The Final_Notebook.pdf file is our project report.

Final_Notebook.ipynb contains our code for the project. If you would like to run the notebook, then you should do so using Google Colab since that was the platform we used to write it.

Final_Notebook.html has all the code from Final_Notebook.ipynb in a read only format.
